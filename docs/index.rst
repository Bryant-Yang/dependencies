Dependencies
============

Dependency Injection for Humans.

Dependency Injection (or simply DI) is great technique.  You can
separate responsibility in you code base.  Define high level
policies and system behavior in one part.  Delegate control to low
level mechanisms from different part.  Simple and powerful.

With help of DI you can use different parts of you system and
change its behavior really easy.

Split behavior and implementation in different classes and you will
see how pleasant it became to change your system.

This tiny library helps you to connect parts of your system i.e. to
inject low level implementation into high level behavior.
